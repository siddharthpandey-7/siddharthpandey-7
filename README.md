### 🚀 **Featured Project**

### **Thyroid Disease Detection: An End-to-End Machine Learning Project**

This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning model to accurately detect thyroid disease from patient data. The solution covers the entire data science lifecycle, from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, feature scaling, and one-hot encoding.
- **Model Development:** Built and evaluated multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- **Deployment:** Deployed the final model using a web framework (e.g., Flask/Streamlit) for real-time predictions.
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, [Mention other libraries you used]

*(When you complete a new project, you can move this section to an "Archived Projects" area and create a new "Featured Project" section at the top.)*

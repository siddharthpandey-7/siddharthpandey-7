## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧪 **Thyroid Disease Prediction System (End-to-End ML + Flask)**

An end-to-end machine learning application to classify **Normal, Hyperthyroid, and Hypothyroid** conditions based on clinical parameters.

**What I built & learned:**
- Trained and evaluated ML models with proper preprocessing
- Used **SMOTE** for class imbalance handling
- Implemented a **complete ML pipeline** (data → model → evaluation)
- Integrated model with a **Flask web application**
- Focused on correctness, validation, and practical deployment

**Model Performance:**  
- Test Accuracy: **97.67%**

**Tech Stack:**  
Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, Flask
